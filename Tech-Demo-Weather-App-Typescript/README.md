## Weather App using Typescript, Tailwind, React and Electron

<br>
This weather app gets the current weather of any given city in the world. The data that is displayed is the current temperature (high and low), and the forecast for the next 36 hours.

Tailwind
- Really small file size after purgecss
- Helps with development and deployment speed
- Allows you to micromanage, each div can be individually managed easily
- Allows you to see which css code is doing exactly what
- dont have to worry about class name
- does help to have the tailwind intellisense extension, otherwise you don't know what you're doing

- JSX and TSX files can start to become large, many lines of code
- It's not all encompassing, sometimes you have to use normal css for more unique and advanced css things.
- normal css exists by default, tailwind requires separate installation
- there is a learning curve to Tailwind, because everything is in acronyms.
- Goes against the principle of having everything separate, normally html and css should be separate.

- typescript is safer and prevents a lot of errors but it takes a lot longer and is frustrating.
- the errors seem to be less descriptive and doesn't explain in an explanatory way. It explains in typescript language and what
types should be there, but this only makes sense if you fully understand typescript
